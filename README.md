# BoardGames through the Ages

`BoardGames Through the Ages` is a Proof of Concept project for Daugherty University. <br />
The team consisted of A Business Analtyics and a Data Engineering student from team Penguin.

We were to select a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/threnjen/board-games-database-from-boardgamegeek) to begin work for the POC.

This POC includes:
- a data profiling 
- a data model from LucidCharts
- the Data Definition Language (DDL) used to create the tables in an RDBMS (Postgres)
- a notebook detailing how to clean, transform, and load into the RDBMS
- some visualizations using PowerBI.

# Data Profiling

# Data Model

# DDL

The Data Definition Language (DDL) was written inside of the notebook to create the tables required for the loading of the data.
